# bunny-test
Test for Head of Engineering

For this test I planned to:

   - Create DOCKER Container for Back-end application
   - Create DOCKER Container for Front-end application
   - Create API to connect to TORRE.BIO API
   - Create HTML to present results
    
I was able to configure the back-end and fron-end environment.
The bakc-end API worked and made the proper communication with TORRE API receiving the content from the json file.
The front-end I had issues and did not succeed.
